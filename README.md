# Git Commit Message Conventionen
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Subject line        
Subject line contains succinct description of the change.

#### Allowed `<type>`
* feat (feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
* refactor
* test (when adding missing tests)
* chore (maintain)

#### Allowed `<scope>`
Scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example $location, $browser, $compile, $rootScope, ngHref, ngClick, ngView, etc...

#### `<subject>` text
* use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Message body
* just as in <subject> use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
* includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

### Message footer

#### Referencing issues

Closed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:
```
Closes #234
```

or in case of multiple issues:
```
Closes #123, #245, #992
```

## Examples

```
feat($browser): onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)

Added new event to $browser:
- forward popstate event if available
- forward hashchange event if popstate not available
- do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available

Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)
```

```
fix($compile): couple of unit tests for IE9

Older IEs serialize html uppercased, but IE9 does not...
Would be better to expect case insensitive, unfortunately jasmine does
not allow to user regexps for throw expectations.

Closes #392
Breaks foo.bar api, foo.baz should be used instead
```

```
feat(directive): ng:disabled, ng:checked, ng:multiple, ng:readonly, ng:selected

New directives for proper binding these attributes in older browsers (IE).
Added coresponding description, live examples and e2e tests.

Closes #351
```

```
style($location): add couple of missing semi colons
```

```
docs(guide): updated fixed docs from Google Docs

Couple of typos fixed:
- indentation
- batchLogbatchLog -> batchLog
- start periodic checking
- missing brace
```
